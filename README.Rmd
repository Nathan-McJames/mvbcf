Welcome to the mvbcf R package! This R package implements the Multivariate Bayesian Causal Forest model introduced in McJames et al., 2024:

McJames, N., Oâ€™Shea, A., Goh, Y. C. & Parnell, A. (2024). Bayesian causal forests for multivariate outcomes: Application to Irish data from an international large scale education assessment. *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A: Statistics in Society*, 1-23. https://doi.org/10.1093/jrsssa/qnae049.
